## Goals for the project
1. Create a finalised visualisation and post it in the challenge
2. Practically use ideas of EDA and from Data Smart in a project

## Plan for the project
1. Investigate the individual questions, find overall statistics of the survey population
2. Investigate further a subset of the survey (e.g. investigate whether Google or Amazon has bigger market share or is thought of as better)
3. Use ideas from Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight to analyse that subset
4. Create clustering model to find interesting subsets.
5. Investigate subsets as in 3.
